# Fast Search
Build a live search engine. The query will fetch data from Twitter, Reddit and other social media pages. 
Show the results. 
All the searches will be cached, so the api won't be fetched all the time.

Show trending topic from google trends and more.

# How content will be displayed
Like a search result on google, only in a different box besides other social media boxes. Clicking the result, 
the user will be forwarded to the social media page.
